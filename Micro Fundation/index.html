          <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
          <p>Many people have heard about all the wonderful, futuristic things that virtual reality could do. For a real estate company or investor, now is the time to leverage VR to lead the market. The most obvious benefit of virtual reality in the field of real estate is that a client is able to see a prospective home as if he or she is actually there. This new way is a fresh and convincing way of marketing a property, but also makes it so much easier to view it. Simpler access to view a home or property lead to more views and obviously the best way of selling real estate is exposure.
Using virtual reality to market a property has the potential to increase investor interest. VR marketing particularly works for high-end homes. This makes sense when considering the large financial commitment that investors make, often from their executive office in another city or even in another country. Despite how realistic the VC content appears, the chance to simply just be present in the place, albeit virtually, could instantly provide an accurate understanding of the space.</p>

          <p>Probably the biggest benefit of virtual reality tours in the field of real estate is that it saves money and time.</p>
          <p>After virtual reality viewing, clients could narrow down their choices, and thus, there will be a decrease in unproductive visits and a boost in serious visit requests.</p>
          <p>Instead of taking and managing thousands and thousands of individual photos, real estate agents and engineers now could simply manage one file and showcase the real space.</p>
          <p>Moreover, rather than preparing for an open house that will last for only a day, companies could now make the place accessible 24/7 and prospective buyers could view or experience the place at their own convenience.</p>
